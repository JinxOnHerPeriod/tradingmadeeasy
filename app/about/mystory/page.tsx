      <p className="mb-6">
        Let’s be real for a second: the whole trading world is confusing as hell. 
        Don’t get me wrong — this is probably the <span className="font-semibold">coolest job in the world</span>. 
        But it’s nothing like the way people on the internet make it look. 
        There are a lot of frauds, a lot of scams - just  a lot of noise. 
        That’s why I always tell people: <span className="font-semibold">only trust sources that actually give you something real</span>.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        When I first started out, I was just like anyone else: excited, curious, 
        and maybe a little too naïve. I tried all the usual stuff — trendlines, support&recistance, 
        fancy strategies people were selling in forums. Some of it worked for a day or two, 
        most of it didn’t. And honestly, it was frustrating. Nothing seemed to stick.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        What nobody tells you is how much <span className="italic">actual work</span> this game takes. 
        Long nights staring at charts, testing strategies that blow up your account, 
        reading books, watching videos, questioning if you’re even on the right track. 
        It’s not glamorous. But it’s the grind that teaches you the truth behind the markets - and mostly - <span className="font-semibold">about yourself.</span>
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        And yeah, I do have paid things — but that’s not some “get rich quick” scheme. 
        It’s simply how I can keep building resources, creating content, and sharing what 
        actually works. Just like you, I’ve only got <span className="font-semibold">two hands and one brain</span>. 
        I’m not here to save the world — but I can definitely help making this journey alot easier for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        So that’s what this journey is about for me. Cutting through the noise, 
        leaving the scams behind, and focusing on what <span className="font-semibold">really moves the needle</span>. 
        If YOU are the one person, that I can save from wasting so much time, energy and point you in the right direction, 
        then all of this is so worth it to me.
