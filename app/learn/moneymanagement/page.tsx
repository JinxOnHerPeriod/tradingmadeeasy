        My trading journey began when I was just 19, back in 2019. Like many others, I stumbled into trading thinking it looked cool and full of potential. I started with the basics — the usual patterns, trendlines, and indicators that everyone tries at first. I even had people around me offering free coaching and lessons.

        But none of it really clicked. The trendline strategies felt vague, and I couldn’t get consistent results. Eventually, I stepped away — though I’d still occasionally draw some support and resistance lines, just out of habit.

        Then one day, during a random game of League of Legends, someone in the match chat said: <q>Check out NNFX.</q> That small comment changed everything. (Thanks, VP — I wouldn’t be here without that moment.)
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        Since then, I’ve had the chance to learn from many incredible traders and educators. Each one helped shape how I view the markets today.

        And that’s why I’m here now — to pass it on. To share a more efficient, no-nonsense approach to trading that can actually get you results without wasting years on fluff.
